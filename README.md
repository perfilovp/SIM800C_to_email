# Motivation 
If you‚Äôre frequently moving between countries or living abroad, chances are you‚Äôve accumulated multiple SIM cards ‚Äî each tied to important services, apps, or two-factor authentication (2FA).
To avoid carrying multiple phones or swapping SIM cards, this tool was created as a lightweight, always-on solution. It automatically:

    ‚úÖ Receives SMS messages

    ‚úÖ Detects incoming calls

    ‚úÖ Forwards both to your Gmail inbox

This way, you‚Äôll never miss critical updates or lose access to services tied to your old numbers ‚Äî even when you're far away.

# SIM800C USB (CH340) on Raspberry Pi with Python

This guide explains how to set up a **SIM800C USB GPRS modem (CH340 serial)** on a Raspberry Pi, receive SMS, detect incoming calls, and forward all events to Gmail using a Python script.

---

## üîß Hardware Required

- Raspberry Pi (any model with USB) / OR ANY OTHER PC with Linux
- SIM800C USB GPRS modem (CH340 USB-to-Serial chip)
- A working SIM card with SMS/call capability
- Internet connection for the Pi (for email forwarding)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Update System

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install Python Libraries

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install pyserial
```

### 3. Verify USB Device

Plug in your SIM800C USB modem and run:

```bash
lsusb
```

You should see something like:

```
QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter
```

Now check the serial port:

```bash
dmesg | grep ttyUSB
```

Expected output:

```
... ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

Your device will be accessible via `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

2. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Create a new App Password (choose **Mail** and **Other (Raspberry Pi)**).
4. Save the 16-character password.

## üöÄ Using the Python Script

### 1. Clone or Download This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perfilovp/SIM800C_to_email.git
cd sim800c-monitor
```

### 2. Edit the Script

Open `sim800c_monitor.py` and update:

```python
GMAIL_USER = "your_email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = "your_16char_apppassword"
EMAIL_TO = "recipient_email@gmail.com"

TARGET_NUMBER = "+1234567890"  # optional test SMS number
SMS_TEXT = "Hello from Raspberry Pi!"
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python3 sim800c_monitor.py
```

The script will:
- Send a test SMS on startup
- Print and forward incoming SMS
- Detect incoming calls and forward caller number

---

## üîÅ Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)

Add this line at the end:

```
@reboot python3 /home/pi/sim800c-monitor/sim800c_monitor.py &
```

## üì§ Example Email Output

**Subject:** `üì© SMS from +447700900123`  
**Body:**
```
Sender: +447700900123

Message:
Your code is 1234
```

**Subject:** `üìû Incoming call from +447700900123`  
**Body:**
```
Incoming call detected from number: +447700900123
```
